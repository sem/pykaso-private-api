```python
from client import Client  # Make sure to save the code as client.py or similar

client = Client('your-email@example.com', 'your-password')

# Get your current credit balance
balance = client.get_total_balance()
print(f"Balance: {balance}")

# Generate 2 portrait-style images from a prompt
result = client.generate_image(prompt="a futuristic cityscape", number_of_images=2)
print(result)

# Fetch summaries of all trained models
models = client.fetch_models_summary()
for model in models:
    print(model)
```

- `number_of_images`: Number of images (max 4).
- Returns a dictionary with:
  - `response`: Raw response text or image-related data
  - `message`: Optional note if number of images was capped

---

### `fetch_models_summary(page: int = 1, page_size: int = 50, max_pages: int = None) -> list`

Fetches summaries of your trained models.

- `page`: Start page.
- `page_size`: Items per page (default: 50).
- `max_pages`: Max number of pages to fetch (None = all).
